<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Ola, a dynamic young lady with a solid educational background in marketing. Originally from Nigeria, I now call France my home, where I enjoy the vibrant culture and beautiful scenery. My interests are diverse;<br> I love cooking delicious meals, swimming to stay fit, cycling through picturesque landscapes, and taking relaxing short walks.</p>

<p>While my French is at an intermediate level, I am fluent in both English and Yoruba. I'm particularly drawn to the colors yellow, blue, orange, white, and black, which often reflect my cheerful and versatile personality.</p>

<p>Currently, I am broadening my skill set by studying Cloud Engineering at ALT School, driven by a passion for technology and innovation. I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth, aiming to make a significant impact in the tech industry.</p>
